"""Google is launching a network of autonomous pizza delivery drones and wants 
you to create a flexible rewards system (Pizza Pointsâ„¢) that can be tweaked in 
the future. The rules are simple: if a customer has made at least N orders of at 
least Y price, they get a FREE pizza!
Create a function that takes a dictionary of customers, a minimum number of orders 
and a minimum order price. Return a list of customers that are eligible for a free pizza."""
